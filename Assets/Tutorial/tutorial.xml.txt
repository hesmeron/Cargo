        Greate comrade! You will enjoy warm for a bit lomnger! Know of course most of OUR trains are a bit looonger. In this case you can't simply do... this thing short as execution of enemies of the working class... You have to DRAGG it as you dragg political prisoner from his warm bed into the cold of Siberian night. Try it comrade!

        Now you won't always deal with only one track. It would be too easy on you! Let's add another one. You will control tracks with left and right side of rat respectively.

        Good comrade very good like an October Revolution. Now ther's something that might help you conduct this task great as a purge itself. All trains are arranged to represent the moelody of OUR great patriotic songs. I don't know why. Probably some zealous comrade wanted to show of his loyalty to the ideology.
